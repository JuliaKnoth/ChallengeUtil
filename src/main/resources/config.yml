# Debug settings
# Control how much debug information is displayed in the server console
debug:
  # When enabled (default: true), only important messages are logged
  # When disabled (false), all debug messages including detailed state changes are shown

# Update checker settings
# The plugin will check for new versions on Modrinth
# This is designed to work safely on 24/7 servers

  enabled: true

# Proxy settings (BungeeCord/Velocity network)
# IMPORTANT: For auto-reconnect to work, you MUST:
# 1. Install ChallengeUtilProxy plugin on your Velocity/BungeeCord proxy
# 2. Enable BungeeCord mode: Set "bungeecord: true" in spigot.yml
# 3. Match server names EXACTLY in your proxy config (velocity.toml or bungee config.yml)
proxy:
  # The lobby server name in your proxy network
  # Players will be sent here during world reset to avoid freezing/kicks
  # Make sure this matches your lobby server name in BungeeCord/Velocity config!
  # Example in velocity.toml: [servers.lobby] -> server name is "lobby"
  lobby-server: lobby
  
  # THIS server's name in your proxy network
  # Used to bring players back after reset completes
  # Make sure this matches this server's name in BungeeCord/Velocity config!
  # Example in velocity.toml: [servers.challenge] -> server name is "challenge"
